BNF is moving in a range. Today BNF made a low and high of 35411 and 35785 respectively. When it crosses 36200 or 34700, then only we will shift the calendars. For now, our trades look liked this at the closing of the day.

The breakevens are still far, so we do nothing until BNF breaches 36200 on the upside.
