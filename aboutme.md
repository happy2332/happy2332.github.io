My name is Happy Mittal. I am a Ph.D scholar in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in) at the [Indian Institute of Technology Delhi](http://www.iitd.ac.in/), working with [Dr. Parag Singla](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~parags). I joined here in July 2013, and planning to submit my thesis soon. In July 2019, I started working as an Applied Scientist II in the [India Machine Learning Team](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/india-machine-learning) at the Amazon Development Center India, Bengaluru.
